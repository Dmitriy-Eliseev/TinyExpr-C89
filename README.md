# TinyExpr-C89 (Adaptation)

This is a C89-compatible adaptation of the [original TinyExpr library](https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr) by Lewis Van Winkle. TinyExpr is a tiny recursive descent parser and evaluation engine for mathematical expressions in C.

The main goal of this adaptation is to make the library usable with old C89 (ANSI C 1989) compilers on DOS systems, such as Turbo C, Borland C++, Open Watcom, or DJGPP. It removes C99-specific features while preserving the original functionality, performance, and API.

**Important**: This is an altered version and not the original software. All changes are distributed under the same Zlib license as the original.

## Features

- Parses and evaluates mathematical expressions (e.g., "2+3*4", "sin(pi/2)", "pow(2,3)").
- Supports variables, built-in functions (sin, cos, pow, etc.), and custom functions.
- Lightweight: No external dependencies beyond standard C libraries.
- **C89 Adaptations**:
  - Removed C99 macros (e.g., those using `__VA_ARGS__` and compound literals).
  - Replaced with direct function calls and fixed-size arrays.
  - Moved variable declarations to the beginning of blocks.
  - Added manual NULL checks and memory management for compatibility with old compilers.
  - No changes to the core parsing or evaluation logic â€” fully equivalent to the original.

For a full list of changes, see the header comments in `tinyexpr.c`.

## Installation and Compilation

### Requirements
- A C89-compatible compiler (e.g., Turbo C 2.0, DJGPP, Open Watcom, or modern GCC/Clang with `-std=c89` flag).
- Standard C libraries: `<stdlib.h>`, `<math.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<ctype.h>`, `<limits.h>`.

### Building
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dmitriy-Eliseev/TinyExpr-C89.git
   cd TinyExpr-C89
   ```

2. Compile
### On Modern Systems (GCC/Clang):
   ```
   gcc -std=c89 -O3 -o example tinyexpr.c example.c -lm
   ```
### On DOS (Open Watcom):
   ```
   wcl -3 -ox -s -fe=EXAMPLE.EXE EXAMPLE.C TINYEXPR.C
   ```

## Usage
Include `tinyexpr.h` in your code and link `tinyexpr.c`.

Available functions:
- `double te_interp(const char *expression, int *error);`
- `te_expr* te_compile(const char *expression, const te_variable *vars, int var_count, int *error);`
- `double te_eval(const te_expr *n);`
- `void te_free(te_expr *n);`

### Example
```c
#include "tinyexpr.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
 const char *expression = "2 + 3 * sin(pi/2)";
 int error;
 double result = te_interp(expression, &error);

 if (error == 0) {
     printf("Result: %f\n", result);  // Output: Result: 5.000000
 } else {
     printf("Error at position %d\n", error);
 }

 return 0;
}
```
